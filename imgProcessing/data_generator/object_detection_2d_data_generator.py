class DataGenerator:
    '''
    A generator to generate batches of samples and corresponding labels indefinitely.

    Can shuffle the dataset consistently after each complete pass.

    Currently provides three methods to parse annotation data: A general-purpose CSV parser,
    an XML parser for the Pascal VOC datasets, and a JSON parser for the MS COCO datasets.
    If the annotations of your dataset are in a format that is not supported by these parsers,
    you could just add another parser method and still use this generator.

    Can perform image transformations for data conversion and data augmentation,
    for details please refer to the documentation of the `generate()` method.

        This class provides parser methods that you call separately after calling the constructor to assemble
        the list of image filenames and the list of labels for the dataset from CSV or XML files. If you already
        have the image filenames and labels in asuitable format (see argument descriptions below), you can pass
        them right here in the constructor, in which case you do not need to call any of the parser methods afterwards.

        In case you would like not to load any labels at all, simply pass a list of image filenames here.

        Arguments:
            labels_output_format (list, optional): A list of five strings representing the desired order of the five
                items class ID, xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax in the generated ground truth data (if any). The expected
                strings are 'xmin', 'ymin', 'xmax', 'ymax', 'class_id'.
            filenames (string or list, optional): `None` or either a Python list/tuple or a string representing
                a filepath. If a list/tuple is passed, it must contain the file names (full paths) of the
                images to be used. Note that the list/tuple must contain the paths to the images,
                not the images themselves. If a filepath string is passed, it must point either to
                (1) a pickled file containing a list/tuple as described above. In this case the `filenames_type`
                argument must be set to `pickle`.
                Or
                (2) a text file. Each line of the text file contains the file name (basename of the file only,
                not the full directory path) to one image and nothing else. In this case the `filenames_type`
                argument must be set to `text` and you must pass the path to the directory that contains the
                images in `images_dir`.
            filenames_type (string, optional): In case a string is passed for `filenames`, this indicates what
                type of file `filenames` is. It can be either 'pickle' for a pickled file or 'text' for a
                plain text file. Defaults to 'text'.
            images_dir (string, optional): In case a text file is passed for `filenames`, the full paths to
                the images will be composed from `images_dir` and the names in the text file, i.e. this
                should be the directory that contains the images to which the text file refers.
                If `filenames_type` is not 'text', then this argument is irrelevant. Defaults to `None`.
            labels (string or list, optional): `None` or either a Python list/tuple or a string representing
                the path to a pickled file containing a list/tuple. The list/tuple must contain Numpy arrays
                that represent the labels of the dataset.
            image_ids (string or list, optional): `None` or either a Python list/tuple or a string representing
                the path to a pickled file containing a list/tuple. The list/tuple must contain the image
                IDs of the images in the dataset.

        Arguments:
            images_dir (str): The path to the directory that contains the images.
            labels_filename (str): The filepath to a CSV file that contains one ground truth bounding box per line
                and each line contains the following six items: image file name, class ID, xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax.
                The six items do not have to be in a specific order, but they must be the first six columns of
                each line. The order of these items in the CSV file must be specified in `input_format`.
                The class ID is an integer greater than zero. Class ID 0 is reserved for the background class.
                `xmin` and `xmax` are the left-most and right-most absolute horizontal coordinates of the box,
                `ymin` and `ymax` are the top-most and bottom-most absolute vertical coordinates of the box.
                The image name is expected to be just the name of the image file without the directory path
                at which the image is located. Defaults to `None`.
            input_format (list): A list of six strings representing the order of the six items
                image file name, class ID, xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax in the input CSV file. The expected strings
                are 'image_name', 'xmin', 'xmax', 'ymin', 'ymax', 'class_id'. Defaults to `None`.
            include_classes (list, optional): Either 'all' or a list of integers containing the class IDs that
                are to be included in the dataset. Defaults to 'all', in which case all boxes will be included
                in the dataset.
            random_sample (float, optional): Either `False` or a float in `[0,1]`. If this is `False`, the
                full dataset will be used by the generator. If this is a float in `[0,1]`, a randomly sampled
                fraction of the dataset will be used, where `random_sample` is the fraction of the dataset
                to be used. For example, if `random_sample = 0.2`, 20 precent of the dataset will be randomly selected,
                the rest will be ommitted. The fraction refers to the number of images, not to the number
                of boxes, i.e. each image that will be added to the dataset will always be added with all
                of its boxes. Defaults to `False`.
            ret (bool, optional): Whether or not the image filenames and labels are to be returned.
                Defaults to `False`.

        Returns:
            None by default, optionally the image filenames and labels.

        This is an XML parser for the Pascal VOC datasets. It might be applicable to other datasets with minor changes to
        the code, but in its current form it expects the data format and XML tags of the Pascal VOC datasets.

        Arguments:
            images_dirs (list): A list of strings, where each string is the path of a directory that
                contains images that are to be part of the dataset. This allows you to aggregate multiple datasets
                into one (e.g. one directory that contains the images for Pascal VOC 2007, another that contains
                the images for Pascal VOC 2012, etc.).
            image_set_filenames (list): A list of strings, where each string is the path of the text file with the image
                set to be loaded. Must be one file per image directory given. These text files define what images in the
                respective image directories are to be part of the dataset and simply contains one image ID per line
                and nothing else.
            annotations_dirs (list, optional): A list of strings, where each string is the path of a directory that
                contains the annotations (XML files) that belong to the images in the respective image directories given.
                The directories must contain one XML file per image and the name of an XML file must be the image ID
                of the image it belongs to. The content of the XML files must be in the Pascal VOC format.
            classes (list, optional): A list containing the names of the object classes as found in the
                `name` XML tags. Must include the class `background` as the first list item. The order of this list
                defines the class IDs. Defaults to the list of Pascal VOC classes in alphabetical order.
            include_classes (list, optional): Either 'all' or a list of integers containing the class IDs that
                are to be included in the dataset. Defaults to 'all', in which case all boxes will be included
                in the dataset.
            exclude_truncated (bool, optional): If `True`, excludes boxes that are labeled as 'truncated'.
            exclude_difficult (bool, optional): If `True`, excludes boxes that are labeled as 'difficult'.

            images_dirs (list, optional): A list of strings, where each string is the path of a directory that
                contains images that are to be part of the dataset. This allows you to aggregate multiple datasets
                into one (e.g. one directory that contains the images for MS COCO Train 2014, another one for MS COCO
                Val 2014, another one for MS COCO Train 2017 etc.).
            annotations_filenames (list): A list of strings, where each string is the path of the JSON file

                JSON file per image directory that contains the annotations for all images in that directory.
                The content of the JSON files must be in MS COCO object detection format. Note that these annotations
                files do not necessarily need to contain ground truth information. MS COCO also provides annotations
                files without ground truth information for the test datasets, called `image_info_[...].json`.
            ground_truth_available (bool, optional): Set `True` if the annotations files contain ground truth information.

                are to be included in the dataset. Defaults to 'all', in which case all boxes will be included

        Generates batches of samples and (optionally) corresponding labels indefinitely.

        Can shuffle the samples consistently after each complete pass.

        Optionally takes a list of arbitrary image transformations to apply to the
        samples ad hoc.

        Arguments:
            batch_size (int, optional): The size of the batches to be generated.
            shuffle (bool, optional): Whether or not to shuffle the dataset before each pass.
                This option should always be `True` during training, but it can be useful to turn shuffling off
                for debugging or if you're using the generator for prediction.
            transformations (list, optional): A list of transformations that will be applied to the images and labels
                in the given order. Each transformation is a callable that takes as input an image (as a Numpy array)
                and optionally labels (also as a Numpy array) and returns an image and optionally labels in the same
                format.
            label_encoder (callable, optional): Only relevant if labels are given. A callable that takes as input the
                labels of a batch (as a list of Numpy arrays) and returns some structure that represents those labels.
                The general use case for this is to convert labels from their input format to a format that a given object
                detection model needs as its training targets.
            returns (set, optional): A set of strings that determines what outputs the generator yields. The generator's output
                is always a tuple with the processed images as its first element and, if labels and a label encoder are given,
                the encoded labels as its second element. Apart from that, the output tuple can contain additional outputs
                according to the keywords specified here. The possible keyword strings and their respective outputs are:
                * 'processed_images': An array containing the processed images. Will always be in the outputs, so it doesn't
                    matter whether or not you include this keyword in the set.
                * 'encoded_labels': The encoded labels tensor. Will always be in the outputs if a label encoder is given,
                    so it doesn't matter whether or not you include this keyword in the set if you pass a label encoder.
                * 'matched_anchors': Only available if `labels_encoder` is an `SSDInputEncoder` object. The same as 'encoded_labels',
                    but containing anchor box coordinates for all matched anchor boxes instead of ground truth coordinates.
                    This can be useful to visualize what anchor boxes are being matched to each ground truth box. Only available
                    in training mode.
                * 'processed_labels': The processed, but not yet encoded labels. This is a list that contains for each
                    batch image a Numpy array with all ground truth boxes for that image. Only available if ground truth is available.
                * 'filenames': A list containing the file names (full paths) of the images in the batch.
                * 'image_ids': A list containing the integer IDs of the images in the batch. Only available if there
                    are image IDs available.
                * 'inverse_transform': A nested list that contains a list of "inverter" functions for each item in the batch.
                    These inverter functions take (predicted) labels for an image as input and apply the inverse of the transformations
                    that were applied to the original image to them. This makes it possible to let the model make predictions on a
                    transformed image and then convert these predictions back to the original image. This is mostly relevant for
                    evaluation: If you want to evaluate your model on a dataset with varying image sizes, then you are forced to
                    transform the images somehow (e.g. by resizing or cropping) to make them all the same size. Your model will then
                    predict boxes for those transformed images, but for the evaluation you will need predictions with respect to the
                    original images, not with respect to the transformed images. This means you will have to transform the predicted
                    box coordinates back to the original image sizes. Note that for each image, the inverter functions for that
                    image need to be applied in the order in which they are given in the respective list for that image.
                * 'original_images': A list containing the original images in the batch before any processing.
                * 'original_labels': A list containing the original ground truth boxes for the images in this batch before any
                    processing. Only available if ground truth is available.
                The order of the outputs in the tuple is the order of the list above. If `returns` contains a keyword for an
                output that is unavailable, that output omitted in the yielded tuples and a warning will be raised.
            keep_images_without_gt (bool, optional): If `False`, images for which there aren't any ground truth boxes before
                any transformations have been applied will be removed from the batch. If `True`, such images will be kept
                in the batch.
            degenerate_box_handling (str, optional): How to handle degenerate boxes, which are boxes that have `xmax <= xmin` and/or
                `ymax <= ymin`. Degenerate boxes can sometimes be in the dataset, or non-degenerate boxes can become degenerate
                after they were processed by transformations. Note that the generator checks for degenerate boxes after all
                transformations have been applied (if any), but before the labels were passed to the `label_encoder` (if one was given).
                Can be one of 'warn' or 'remove'. If 'warn', the generator will merely print a warning to let you know that there
                are degenerate boxes in a batch. If 'remove', the generator will remove degenerate boxes from the batch silently.

        Yields:
            The next batch as a tuple of items as defined by the `returns` argument. By default, this will be
            a 2-tuple containing the processed batch images as its first element and the encoded ground truth boxes
            tensor as its second element if in training mode, or a 1-tuple containing only the processed batch images if
            not in training mode. Any additional outputs must be specified in the `returns` argument.
