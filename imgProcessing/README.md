# Detecting Rovio as on object in images using SSD Keras
original library here:
https://github.com/pierluigiferrari/ssd_keras

Modified to detect Wowwee Rovio bot in images, as part of a robotics assignment where 2 of our rovios play hide and seek. This code is part of the seeker bot's functionality.

### Dependencies

* Python 3.x (Python 2.7 seems to work, but isn't actively supported)
* Numpy
* TensorFlow 1.x
* Keras 2.x
* OpenCV
* Beautiful Soup 4.x

### To run
`python sina.py`
or
`python3 sina.py` 
if you have multiple versions of python

### credits
I'm using Kam Woh Ng's (@kamwoh) pre-trained Rovio model in this code, and lots of his guidance.
